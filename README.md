Hello!

This is a simple program. I assume that you all have Go installed on your laptop so building the code, running and adding unittests should all be pretty straight forward.

To Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/seanmdeleon/NumberRanges.git

To test the code, my recommendation is to add unittests to the main_test.go file. I use VScode as my IDE, so it makes running tests easy.
If you would like to use the command line instead to run tests:

    go test

on the command line in the top level directory

If you want to build the code and update the main() function with tests:

    go build -o main
    ./main

If you have any questions, please reach out to me
A conversation around scalabiltiy could take place
